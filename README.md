### Hello! üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I'm Ricardo.

I am a Certified Project Manager with 10 years of experience in Project Management. Seeking a career change, I have been learning and developing my skills as a Full Stack Software Developer for the past year.
I have just finished my Diploma with Code Institute where I gained the amazing experience of building 5 Portfolio Projects. The links to these projects are listed below. I am now focusing on learning and developing my skills further with React. I can't wait to show you my results soon.
